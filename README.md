## Overview
In this repository, you will find various implementations of data structures and algorithms in Python. Understanding DSA is crucial for any programmer, and this repository is here to assist you in mastering these fundamental concepts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your system
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.6 or higher) installed on your system

### Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/git-Tommaso/DSA.git
   ```
4. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA
   ```

### Forking the Repository
To fork this repository:

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub: https://github.com/git-Tommaso/DSA
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination
4. Once forked, you can clone your fork using the same steps as above, but with your fork's URL

### Running the Code
Since this repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms, you can run any of the examples directly:

1. Navigate to the specific algorithm or data structure folder you're interested in
2. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

For example, to run a sorting algorithm:
```bash
cd SortingAlgorithms
python bubble_sort.py
```

### Installing Dependencies
Most of the implementations in this repository use only Python's standard library, so no additional dependencies are required. However, if you want to run tests or use visualization tools, you might need to install some packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository Structure

### BinarySearchTree/
A binary search tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children. The left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, while the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node. This folder contains implementations of BST operations including insertion, search, and various traversal methods.

### Graph/
Graphs are non-linear data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. This folder contains implementations of various graph algorithms including depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.

### HashTable/
Hash tables are data structures that implement an associative array abstract data type, mapping keys to values. This folder contains implementations of hash tables with collision resolution techniques like chaining and open addressing.

### Heap/
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. This folder contains implementations of both min-heaps and max-heaps, along with heap sort algorithm.

### LinkedList/
Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. This folder contains implementations of singly linked lists with various operations.

### DoubleLinkedList/
Double linked lists are similar to linked lists but each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes. This folder contains implementations of doubly linked lists with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal in both directions.

### Queue/
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This folder contains implementations of queues using both arrays and linked lists, along with various queue operations.

### Stack/
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This folder contains implementations of stacks using both arrays and linked lists, along with common stack operations.

### SortingAlgorithms/
This folder contains implementations of various sorting algorithms including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Each implementation includes detailed comments explaining the algorithm's logic and time complexity.

### Recursion/
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This folder contains examples of recursive algorithms and problems, including factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence, and tree traversals.

### Memorization/
Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls. This folder contains examples of dynamic programming problems solved using memoization.
