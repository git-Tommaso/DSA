2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination
4. Once forked, you can clone your fork using the same steps as above, but with your fork's URL

### Running the Code
Since this repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms, you can run any of the examples directly:

1. Navigate to the specific algorithm or data structure folder you're interested in
2. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

For example, to run a sorting algorithm:
```bash
cd SortingAlgorithms
python bubble_sort.py
```

### <a name="binarysearchtree"></a>BinarySearchTree/
A binary search tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children. The left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, while the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node. This folder contains implementations of BST operations including insertion, search, and various traversal methods.

### <a name="graph"></a>Graph/
Graphs are non-linear data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. This folder contains implementations of various graph algorithms including depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.

### <a name="hashtable"></a>HashTable/
Hash tables are data structures that implement an associative array abstract data type, mapping keys to values. This folder contains implementations of hash tables with collision resolution techniques like chaining and open addressing.

### <a name="heap"></a>Heap/
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. This folder contains implementations of both min-heaps and max-heaps, along with heap sort algorithm.

### <a name="linkedlist"></a>LinkedList/
Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. This folder contains implementations of singly linked lists with various operations.

### <a name="doublelinkedlist"></a>DoubleLinkedList/
Double linked lists are similar to linked lists but each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes. This folder contains implementations of doubly linked lists with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal in both directions.

### <a name="queue"></a>Queue/
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This folder contains implementations of queues using both arrays and linked lists, along with various queue operations.

### <a name="stack"></a>Stack/
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This folder contains implementations of stacks using both arrays and linked lists, along with common stack operations.

### <a name="sortingalgorithms"></a>SortingAlgorithms/
This folder contains implementations of various sorting algorithms including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Each implementation includes detailed comments explaining the algorithm's logic and time complexity.

### <a name="recursion"></a>Recursion/
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This folder contains examples of recursive algorithms and problems, including factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence, and tree traversals.

### <a name="memorization"></a>Memorization/
Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls. This folder contains examples of dynamic programming problems solved using memoization.

## Recommended Set-Up

While learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms, I recommend using the following setup to maximize your productivity and learning experience:

![Recommended IDE Setup](Recomended_Set-up/immagine%20setup.jpg)

This setup includes:
- A code editor/IDE with split view functionality
- One pane for your implementation code
- Another pane for your test/main file
- A terminal/output window at the bottom to see your results

This arrangement allows you to:
1. See your implementation and usage side by side
2. Quickly make changes and see the results
3. Debug more effectively by having all components visible at once
4. Better understand how your data structures and algorithms work in practice

Feel free to adjust this setup according to your preferences, but maintaining the ability to see both your implementation and usage simultaneously is highly recommended for an optimal learning experience.
